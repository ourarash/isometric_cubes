# isometric_cubes

This is a sketch based on what I used to draw in highschool.

I used [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) platform.

The original picture that inspired me is below and it was taken from [here](https://bayanbox.ir/info/2562979592567348167/2014-05-10-11.31.36).

The current result looks like this:

I made it animated and rotating. It still misses the hearts :)
